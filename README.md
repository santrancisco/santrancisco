This is where i store my public code. Even though I spent most of my time in the IT Security industry doing pentesting, I also like building simple things with minimal footprint and low maintainance on the side. 

[Relay secret](https://github.com/santrancisco/relaysecret) is a good example of that. I also built many cloudflare worker tools/utilities to assist me with pentesting. [Cheat](https://github.com/santrancisco/cheat) is another super simple utility I use everyday to note down interesting commands I use daily and host it on surge.sh for quick access.[DRAT](https://github.com/santrancisco/DRAT_legacy_deprecated) is my ambitious project which takes completely new approach in identifying "high risk" dependencies in your code base by identifying dependencies/projects that has been abandoned, not well looked after or having just one single contributor. 

Since you are here, i made a quick & fun challenge/ctf:
